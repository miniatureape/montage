## Montage

A little shell script to:

- Take a bunch of jpgs in a folder...
- Make them all landscape
- Center crop them
- Lay them out into one giant jpg

## Requirements

imagemagick (and ghostscript because one of the imagemagick commands requires it)

## Usage

Drop it in a folder and ```./montage.sh```

See the example file for an example of the results (note that this example has been reduced in size).
